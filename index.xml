      <description>Several months ago, great Yihui Xie started a new package called blogdown for easy webpage and blogs creation with R markdown, which kept my attention. Since then many blogs that I follow as Hyndman, Romain François, Simply Statistics have switched to blogdown.
I have been blogging in Barcelona R Users group blog. At some point I stopped but I always missed it. It was a great way to share and learn things and to clarify ideas about what you write, doesn’t matter if it is about packages, functions or programming.</description>

      <description>I am a Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast. On the field for several years I feel that every time I have more stuff left to learn.
I believe that sharing knowledge is a great way to improve both individually and collectively. I try to be active in the Barcelona Data Science community and I am co-organizer of Barcelona R users Group and Machine Learning Study Group.
You can find me in meetups but also in github, twitter and linkedIn.</description>
